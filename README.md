# Challenge Hunt

##### All programming challenges at one place

Challenge Hunt is your companion in hunting online programming challenges. It shows you all the active, upcoming and archived challenges from over 25 platforms. You can set your preferred online challenge platforms and Challenge Hunt will show you challenges from only those platforms. To save you from the pain of visiting the extension just to check the active contest we have included a red badge which does that for you.

Happy Hunting!
